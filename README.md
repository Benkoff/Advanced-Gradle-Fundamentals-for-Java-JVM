<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The Advanced Gradle Fundamentals training course is an extensive hands-on, 4 half-day Gradle training course for build masters and developers who are familiar with Gradle and are authoring and maintaining their builds. Participants will learn how to use the Gradle build system to substantially increase their productivity. This Gradle training class dives into the more advanced fundamental features of the Gradle build system.</p>
<p>Participants will spend a significant portion of the class with their hands on the keyboard, learning
by doing, working through lab exercises designed to build on the presented material and explore the depths of Gradle. This class can take you from complete newcomer status to Gradle competence. Due to the in-depth treatment of the topics it is also very suitable for people who have experience working with Gradle. The class will be delivered by a Gradle Core Developer which gives you access to the deepest Gradle knowledge available. No question will remain unanswered.</p>
